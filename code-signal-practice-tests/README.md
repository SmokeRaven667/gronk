## ascii-pyramid (aka xmas tree)

practice question from codesignal

We can render an ASCII art pyramid with N levels by printing N rows of asterisks, where the top row has a single asterisk in the center and each successive row has two additional asterisks on either side.

Here's what that looks like when N is equal to 3.

```
  *
 ***
*****
```

And here's what it looks like when N is equal to 5.

```
    *
   ***
  *****
 *******
*********
```

Can you write a program that generates this pyramid with a N value of 10?
